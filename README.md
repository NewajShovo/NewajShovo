### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer with 5+ years of experience in iOS and moderate full-stack web development. Proficient in Objective-C, Swift, SwiftUI, Laravel, JavaScript, React, and Python. Skilled in building custom UI/UX and optimizing performance using AVFoundation, MetalPetal, and Core Animation. 

Iâ€™m currently working as the technical lead at our EdTech startupâ€”managing sprints, mentoring teammates, and making core architectural decisions. At the same time, Iâ€™m focusing on sharpening my skills as a fullstack/backend developer and growing into a better software engineer overall.


Passionate about solving complex problems and eager to take on new challenges in iOS, backend, or full-stack roles. Love to learn new things and take new challenges.
